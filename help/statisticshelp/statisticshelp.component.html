        <p style="color: white; text-align: left">Stuff you want to know about the statistics module implemented into ServerManager</p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: large; text-align: left">What data is primarily collected?</p>
        <p style="color: white; text-align: left">The information primarily collected is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li style="text-align: left; color: white">How many BungeeCord servers are using ServerManager?</li>
          <li style="text-align: left; color: white">How many servers are orchestrated via ServerManager?</li>
          <li style="text-align: left; color: white">How many players are on those servers?</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: large; text-align: left">What data is collected as well?</p>
        <p style="color: white; text-align: left">Some errors that occur during runtime are collected as well. This helps improve the plugin for all of us. So if
          you're willing to provide information about your usage and other stuff feel free to activate it in the config. Stats are enabled by default.
          If you want to disable the stats module see: <a href="#" class="link-footer">URL TBA</a></p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: large; text-align: left">Can someone identify me with this information?</p>
        <p style="color: white; text-align: left">No. We don't collect information like IP-Addresses or something like that. You receive a stats-ID, when you start up your ServerManager and
          have that stats module enabled. The stats-ID is used to prevent spamming and abuse of the service. That stats-ID is not associated with any collected information.</p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: large; text-align: left">What is the purpose of collecting that data?</p>
        <p style="color: white; text-align: left">As mentioned above, the collected data is used to improve the plugin. Error logs enable the ability to identify potential issues that users
          encounter, that are not an individual phenomenon. Also we are then able to see how many servers are orchestrated and how many people are actually using the plugin.</p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: large; text-align: left">Might the amount of collected data change in the future?</p>
        <p style="color: white; text-align: left">Probably yes. As the amount of feature is increasing we might collect more data to improve features and
          gain knowledge of how the features are used. But when we do so, this page is going to be updated.</p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: large; text-align: left">Can I opt out of the data collection / stats?</p>
        <p style="color: white; text-align: left">Yes, you're totally able to do so. The collection of data is entirely voluntary. You can decide whether you want to participate in the
          stats program or not.</p>
